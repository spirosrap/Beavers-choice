# Multi-Agent System for Paper Supply Management

This project implements a multi-agent system for managing paper supply operations, including inventory management, quoting, sales, finance, and customer service.

## System Architecture

### Agent Workflow Diagram
The system's architecture is visualized in `flowchart.md` using Mermaid diagram syntax. To view the diagram:

1. **Using GitHub**: The diagram will automatically render in the GitHub web interface
2. **Using VS Code**: Install the "Markdown Preview Mermaid Support" extension
3. **Using other editors**: Use a Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid diagrams

The flowchart shows:

1. **Central Orchestrator**
   - Coordinates all agent activities
   - Manages workflow sequencing
   - Handles inter-agent communication

2. **Specialized Agents and Their Tools**
   - **Customer Service Agent**
     - Check Stock
     - Get Item Price
     - Search Quote History
   
   - **Inventory Agent**
     - Check Stock
     - Create Transaction
     - Get All Inventory
     - Get Supplier Delivery Date
   
   - **Quoting Agent**
     - Get Item Price
     - Check Stock
     - Search Quote History
     - Get Cash Balance
   
   - **Sales Agent**
     - Check Stock
     - Create Transaction
     - Get Item Price
     - Generate Financial Report
   
   - **Finance Agent**
     - Get Cash Balance
     - Generate Financial Report
     - Create Transaction

3. **Data Flow**
   - Solid lines (→) show direct agent-to-tool connections
   - Dotted lines (-.→) show inter-agent communication paths
   - Legend explains the different connection types

### Key Components
- `main.py`: Entry point for the application
- `orchestrator.py`: Orchestrator agent implementation
- `agents.py`: Worker agent implementations
- `tools.py`: Tool definitions and implementations
- `config.py`: System configuration
- `project_starter.py`: Database initialization and helper functions

## Setup and Installation

1. **Prerequisites**
   ```bash
   Python 3.8+
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # The database will be automatically initialized on first run
   python main.py
   ```

## Running the System

### Basic Usage
```bash
python main.py
```
This will:
- Initialize the database
- Set up the agent system
- Process sample requests

### Test Cases
```bash
# Run all test cases
python test_agents.py

# Run specific test cases
python test_agents.py test_quote_request
python test_agents.py test_sale_request
python test_agents.py test_customer_inquiry
```

### System Evaluation
```bash
# Run comprehensive system evaluation
python evaluate_system.py
```
This will:
- Process a set of test requests
- Generate performance metrics
- Create evaluation reports

## Understanding the Results

### Test Results
- `test_results.csv`: Contains detailed test results
- `evaluation_results.csv`: Contains system evaluation metrics

### Reflection Report
The system's architecture, implementation, and evaluation are documented in `reflection_report.md`, which includes:
1. Agent Workflow Architecture
2. System Strengths
3. Evaluation Results
4. Customer-Facing Output Management
5. Suggested Improvements
